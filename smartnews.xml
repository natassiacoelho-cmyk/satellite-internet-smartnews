  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s simple to buy or sell a used Starlink kit, but there are a few steps you need to follow. One thing that sets Starlink apart from any other satellite internet provider is that its hardware is transferable to a different owner. Customers can sell their equipment when they no longer need it to recoup their investment, which is excellent for people who want a Starlink kit but want to save money by buying one used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I decided to swap out my Standard Starlink dish for the Starlink Mini since I mainly use it seasonally and would like to take it with me when traveling. A friend of mine was willing to trade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giving a Starlink kit to another user isn’t as simple as handing it over. You need to follow these instructions to transfer the kit; otherwise, it won’t work, and the recipient will be stuck with inoperable Starlink equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon is aiming to introduce its satellite internet solution for travelers, RVs, and nomads&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Everything We Know About Amazon Leo’s Mobile Satellite Internet&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;graphic src="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/app/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-06-162849-1024x646.webp"/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A rendering of the Amazon Leo Nano dish, a direct competitor to Starlink's popular Mini dish for portable satellite internet. | Image by Amazon&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon Leo (formerly known as Project Kuiper) is a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite internet service aiming to directly compete with Starlink, offering high-speed internet nearly anywhere in the world, including while traveling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The retail and web service giant is entering the internet industry with its own satellite-based solution, leveraging a planned constellation of 3,200 satellites. What’s noteworthy about this endeavor&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;What is Amazon Leo’s plan for mobile internet?&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Starlink first debuted in 2021, it was only a fixed-location satellite internet service, but it made waves with its Roam service, which launched about a year later. It allowed customers to take their Starlink dishes on the road with them and get speedy, reliable internet access from their campers, vans, or anywhere they could get a clear view of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, Amazon Leo is hoping to be the second satellite internet service to match Starlink's mobile capabilities, with its own network and hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Amazon Leo hardware comparison&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon Leo kicked off its rebrand announcement by revealing the three dishes it will launch its service with. Each dish directly corresponds to three of Starlink’s primary hardware offerings: a Standard dish for residential and mobile use, the Mini for even greater portability, and a High-performance version for business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;graphic src="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-11-13-155124-1024x402.webp"/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Amazon Leo Pro is likely to be the go-to choice for home internet use, but it can also be used on the go like the Starlink Standard. It’s an 11” by 11” square dish capable of download speeds up to 400 Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don’t need as much speed and want an even more portable dish, the Nano is Amazon Leo’s answer to Starlink’s popular Mini dish. It’s a 7” by 7” dish with download speeds up to 100 Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, there’s the Amazon Leo Ultra, which is being marketed for business use. It can definitely be mobile, since it can be fitted to trucks, trains, planes, and ships. It’s also capable of 1 Gbps download speeds and improved upload speeds, as businesses need. Pricing hasn't been announced yet, but it’s certainly going to be the most expensive. To compare, Starlink’s own High-Performance dish costs $1,999.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;How much will Amazon Leo cost?&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon Leo has not announced pricing details, including how it will break down its service and hardware costs. It’s even unclear whether Amazon Leo plans to follow Starlink’s model of requiring upfront hardware costs or to lease its equipment, as most other internet providers do, a practice Starlink has begun in select markets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only details Amazon provided are that it will be “priced competitively,” so it’s reasonable to assume it will be priced similarly to Starlink.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;What makes Amazon Leo's mobile service different from Starlink’s?&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon Leo clearly shares many similarities with Starlink internet, but many details remain unknown, making it hard to contrast the two at present. They're both made possible by a constellation of thousands of LEO satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starlink is already well established, with nearly 10,000 satellites already launched, which has led to considerable improvements to its overall performance. Amazon Leo’s initial goal is 3,200 satellites, but it hasn’t ruled out more in the future. As of the beginning of 2026, Amazon still has a long way to go to reach this milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A key difference Amazon boasts is its satellites' ability to create a global mesh to boost transmission speeds and reduce latency. According to Amazon, its optical inter-satellite link (OISL) technology can sustain consistent transmission speeds, meaning that its first wave of satellites will be ready to link up upon launch. It also claims it will leverage Amazon Web Services (AWS) to further increase speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div data-widget="text-content" class="text-content text-content--align-default text--p-medium text--color- component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starlink’s budget home internet plan is Residential Lite. For $80 per month, you can get a pared-down version of Starlink’s regular Residential plan, which offers lower-priority bandwidth but still delivers download speeds of up to 200Mbps. The catch is that Starlink Residential Lite is not available everywhere and is only accessible to those living in non-congested areas of Starlink’s network. While it continues to improve its network bandwidth, there are still select areas, especially heavily populated metropolitan areas, where a cheaper plan is not available, and Starlink may charge a congestion fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most significant barrier to getting Starlink's affordable plan is the upfront hardware cost. The hardware most recommended for home internet, the Standard Starlink dish's regular price is $349. Starlink rents its dishes at no cost in select regions, but it’s unclear which regions specifically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div data-widget="text-content" class="text-content text-content--align-default text--p-medium text--color- component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starlink has also rolled out an even more affordable $40-per-month plan, capped at 100 Mbps. This plan has even less availability and is only accessible in select rural areas, though it may expand to more regions as Starlink increases bandwidth. Starlink doesn’t list where the plan is available, so customers need to check its website to see if their address is in one of these regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div data-widget="text-content" class="text-content text-content--align-default text--p-medium text--color- component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starlink does have a cheaper plan on its Roam line of packages. It's $50 per month for 50GB of data. However, Starlink strongly discourages using a Roam package as a home internet solution, as it's meant for travel. If Starlink detects you’re using a Roam package in a single location for a certain number of days (typically 60), it can, at its discretion, charge you a fee or require you to change or cancel your plan. It’s not recommended to use Roam as home internet, as it’s also deprioritized behind Residential plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;

            <pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 16:42:46 +0000</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latest innovations in farming include sensors to monitor weather conditions, control irrigation, GPS to track the supply chain, and software to automate business processes. It all needs reliable, strong Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;The Best Farm Wi-Fi Solutions (2026)&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;graphic src="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/app/uploads/2025/10/iStock-1148006026-1024x683.webp"/&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Large farming operations require real-time data across extensive acreage and multiple properties. Reliable internet solutions power the technology to do it. | Image by iStock&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Can you get Wi-Fi solutions on a farm?&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern farming is highly dependent on the latest equipment and communication tools to operate efficiently and smoothly. A reliable internet connection is essential for maintaining synchronization and delivering accurate data, with strong Wi-Fi to bridge it across the property. Whether it’s monitoring autonomous equipment, running security cameras, or managing day-to-day business operations, high-speed Wi-Fi is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, establishing a connection that reliably runs throughout your properties can be challenging. You need an internet provider that can deliver fast speeds in rural locations, and preferably one that provides unlimited data for a fair value. Then, you need to connect everything through a strong Wi-Fi signal, which is another challenge. Here’s what we’ve found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Long-range farm Wi-Fi solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you’ve selected your ideal farm internet provider, you need to determine how to deploy it throughout your operation, a particularly challenging task due to the large, multi-property nature of agriculture. Here are our recommended options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Budget: Outdoor Wi-Fi extenders&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the simplest ways to spread Wi-Fi across your farm is to set up an outdoor Wi-Fi extender—or a whole system of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wi-Fi extenders pick up your existing network’s signal and boost it using an antenna built into the extender equipment. There are several types (and they’re sometimes referred to as Wi-Fi antennas, Wi-Fi repeaters, etc.), but these are the best suited for outdoor use and are typically affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*As of 7/13/2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Mid-Range: Mesh Wi-Fi Systems (Asus ZenWi-Fi)&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Outdoor Wi-Fi extenders are great, but a mesh Wi-Fi system is more reliable and better suited for businesses that require strong, far-reaching connectivity. Mesh Wi-Fi systems, unlike extenders and repeaters, broadcast the original signal from multiple points, acting as a network of routers that create a stronger and larger signal area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Asus ZenWi-Fi system provides significantly better signal coverage over larger areas than a Wi-Fi extender can, and it’s our recommendation for the easiest and most convenient mesh system option for establishing farm Wi-Fi. The ASUS Wi-Fi 6 version is affordable and powerful enough to cover medium-sized farms, and is easily scalable as your operations grow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;graphic src="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/app/uploads/2025/10/Arystone-AryMesh-e1759956477594.webp"/&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Arystone Hubs placed throughout large properties communicate with each other and broadcast Wi-Fi. | Image by Ayrstone&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ayrstone is a full-scale farm connectivity solution designed specifically for agriculture in rural geographic areas. It touts its easy-to-install and maintain equipment, which is fully scalable to vast properties. It offers a small suite of products dedicated to helping you establish a solid, wireless farm internet connection, including outdoor Wi-Fi hubs for extending the signal into the farthest fields, indoor hubs for connecting your outbuildings, and receivers to connect your field equipment to the network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get Wi-Fi in your tractor cab, keep your land secure with wireless cameras, and even maintain a fleet of autonomous vehicles that are reliably connected to your network. The Ayrmesh Hubs are designed to stretch a signal for several miles with multiple hubs. Equipment is designed to be weather-resistant and capable of operating in most conditions. Additionally, its hubs are solar power-ready. The best place to start is with the Hub 2x2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Best farm internet providers&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are several solutions for getting internet in rural locations, and the industry for rural internet has undergone considerable innovations, with one of the impressive types of providers being satellite internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Satellite internet - For the most remote farms&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Satellite internet providers have been rapidly improving and are now being used by farmers everywhere to ensure their businesses remain connected. Satellite internet is available to 99 percent of the U.S., and has proven to be a reliable connection. The three satellite internet providers currently available are Hughesnet, Starlink, and Viasat. Each offers business-oriented plans that provide priority service and support; however, depending on the scope of your operation, your needs, and location, a residential plan may also be a suitable option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starlink is currently the only satellite internet provider that can be used on the move with Starlink Roam, allowing you to connect autonomous equipment directly to a speedy internet connection if Wi-Fi is unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Fixed-wireless internet - For affordable, unlimited data&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fixed-wireless internet has also been on the rise and has become more accessible in rural locations, leveraging far-reaching 5G networks. The country’s largest mobile carriers all offer internet services, with business plans and products tailored to both small and enterprise-sized companies. It’s a type of internet that’s also ideal for rural businesses when wired connections are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*w/ Auto Pay and qualifying mobile plan. Regulatory fees included in monthly price for qualified accounts. See full terms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;**w/ Auto Pay. Available in select areas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;***Consumer data usage is subject to the usage restrictions set forth in Verizon's terms of service; visit: https://www.verizon.com/support/customer-agreement/ for more information about 5G Home and LTE Home Internet or https://www.verizon.com/about/terms-conditions/verizon-customer-agreement for Fios internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Fiber/Cable -Speedy internet and the preferred choice if available&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fiber is by far the fastest internet solution and is typically very affordable. It requires significant investment to build out its infrastructure, especially in rural areas. However, if it is an option for your farm, it’s a reliable and lightning-fast internet option that’s perfect for any business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Why is reliable internet essential for modern farming?&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. agricultural industry benefits greatly from implementing modern networking technology and practices, keeping farms competitive with new ways of operating the business. Whether it’s for improved security, better communication, data gathering and analysis, or automation, a reliable internet provider and network are essential for keeping businesses efficient and profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latest innovations in farming include sensors to monitor weather conditions, control irrigation, GPS to track the supply chain, and software to automate business processes. Overcome the challenges of getting a strong internet connection to your farm with highly available satellite internet, reliable fixed-wireless internet, or speedy fiber and cable connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Getting Wi-Fi on your farm FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Can I install Wi-Fi in rural areas?&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyone can install Wi-Fi in a rural area, but your options may be limited depending on your precise location. You can often find Spectrum in rural areas, and satellite internet can be set up in 99% of the U.S., for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to convince an internet provider to lay internet infrastructure in your rural area, you can reach out to an internet service provider and offer to pay up-front for the infrastructure, or you can form a co-op and together with your neighbors split the upfront costs to get better internet options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Why is it so hard to get Wi-Fi out in rural areas?&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Internet service providers (ISPs) have to build out expensive infrastructure in order to bring internet access to a certain area, and unfortunately, because rural areas typically have fewer people spaced further apart, ISPs get much better return on investment from cities. Fortunately, with satellite internet services like Starlink, Viasat, and Hughesnet, even rural areas can get internet access as long as there’s a clear view of the southern sky.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;

            <title>Starlink vs. Fiber: Which is Better for Your Home in 2026?</title>
            <link>https://www.satelliteinternet.com/resources/starlink-vs-fiber/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div data-widget="text-content" class="text-content text-content--align-default text--p-medium text--color- component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber internet uses fiber optic cables to transmit data. These cables are made of super-thin glass strands bundled together. A laser at either end of the cable sends light pulses through the glass cables—this light carries the data. These pulses of light move extremely quickly and can take an enormous amount of data, so fiber is generally the fastest and most efficient internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several excellent fiber providers on the market. Which one is best often comes down to where you live—these services tend to be fairly regional, and which one is best in your area might be very different from which one is best, even a town or two over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiber is also an excellent value for money. You can frequently find 1,000Mbps fiber plans for less than $80 per month, which is a fantastic deal—better than you'll find with any other type of internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, we are big fans of AT&amp;amp;T Fiber, Earthlink, T-Mobile Fiber, and Spectrum for their growing availability. Each offers excellent value, superfast speeds, and good customer support. The latter is a big deal because Starlink's customer support is not our favorite. Its unorthodox approach to support is hands-off, including installation, if you plan to mount the dish permanently on your home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is one of the fastest fiber internet providers in the country, with speeds up to 5,000 Mbps. The more standard 1,000Mbps plan is less than $80 per month, which is a steal. AT&amp;amp;T is also a very reliable service; we've had a great experience with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Starlink Mini is SpaceX's satellite internet dish, engineered to be lightweight and portable. Released in early 2024, the Starlink Mini is about half the size of the Standard and much lighter. It's engineered to be as portable as possible, making it easy to take on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Starlink Standard kit is actually the third iteration of the satellite internet provider's hardware. It replaced the Standard Actuated kit, going for a more straightforward design that doesn't require the motorized stand. It is larger and more powerful than the Mini, designed to achieve higher speeds in stationary use. The Starlink Mini is ideal for portability and can be used on the go, but it's more expensive and less powerful than the Standard. In this guide, we'll break down all the key differences between the Starlink Standard and the Starlink Mini.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will Amazon Leo be able to compete with Starlink, which has discounted its equipment and service several times?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;How Much Will Amazon Leo Cost?&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;graphic src="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/app/uploads/2025/12/hugoreveal-brand-aurora-1.webp"/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An early first look at Amazon Leo's Ultra dish that will directly compete with Starlink's own satellite internet equipment. | Image by Amazon&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon Leo is an upcoming satellite internet provider that will directly compete with Starlink and other rural internet companies. How much Amazon's success will depend, in part, on the price, which has not officially been announced. Amazon Leo, formerly known as Project Kuiper, has previously remarked that it will be competitively priced upon release, without specifying a price range. That statement has since been removed from its website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we don’t yet know how Amazon Leo's pricing structure will work, given their similarities, we can examine Starlink's history for clues about how Amazon may price its service. Starlink took an unorthodox approach to its internet service by selling its equipment directly to the customer, rather than leasing it. It’s unclear whether Amazon will take a similar approach, but given the portable nature of its devices, we lean towards the retailer adopting an upfront purchasing approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;What can Starlink tell us about Amazon Leo's pricing?&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starlink launched in 2021 for those who pre-ordered a dish for $599. Starlink would eventually reduce the price of its Standard dish from $499 to $349 in early 2025. Starlink’s portable solution, Starlink Mini, launched in 2024 at $499 and has since been reduced to $299. Furthermore, the enterprise-level dish, High-Performance dish, is currently $1,999.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starlink charges $80 to $120 monthly for its Residential service. Pricing for this plan has been consistent, with Starlink occasionally discounting it in regions where there's excess bandwidth. Inversely, Starlink sometimes adds a congestion charge in areas where the network is at capacity. As Amazon builds out its satellite internet constellation, pricing may fluctuate as it carefully onboards customers and balances its own bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Will I have to pay to be the first to try Amazon Leo?&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a good chance Amazon Leo will start accepting its first customers from the waiting list. When Starlink first started, customers on the waiting list needed to pay a $90 deposit to eventually get the first dishes. Amazon Leo could do something similar, such as accepting deposits or preorders for its first round of dishes for a consumer beta test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Will Amazon Leo be included with Amazon Prime?&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a definite possibility, though it’s more likely to be an add-on subscription. We know Amazon likes to keep its many services under the umbrella of a single Prime account, so it’s not out of the realm of possibility that Leo would be part of that ecosystem. Whether or not being a Prime member will include a discount or first dibs on the rollout of Leo is anyone’s guess.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;When will we know the pricing of Amazon Leo?&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon Leo’s latest marketing push indicates that it's still determined to begin service in Q1 of 2026. However, it's still unclear to what extent the initial launch will be and whether it will even include consumers, since its new website has placed much emphasis on enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div data-widget="text-content" class="text-content text-content--align-default text--p-medium text--color- component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verizon offers the most variety and value with its hotspot plans compared to other major carriers. It offers more data for lower prices, but only if you’re already a Verizon mobile customer. Its plans can be used with any modern hotspot device, although Verizon also sells its recommended devices on payment plans added to your monthly plan.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div data-widget="text-content" class="text-content text-content--align-default text--p-medium text--color- component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device I recommend to go along with a Verizon hotspot plan is the Inseego MiFi X PRO. It’s an affordable hotspot device on a payment plan of $9.72 per month. It’s no bigger than a smartphone and has its own rechargeable battery that lasts up to 13 hours unplugged. It has Wi-Fi 6, which has extended reach and can connect to up to 32 devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div data-widget="text-content" class="text-content text-content--align-default text--p-medium text--color- component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly every modern smartphone comes with a tethering feature that allows it to function as a hotspot. So why use a device and a separate plan? Phone hotspot data is often very limited, and going over your plan’s cap can result in hefty overage charges. A phone’s Wi-Fi reach is very limited and can only connect a few devices at a time. Plus, frequently using your phone rapidly drains its battery and shortens its lifespan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using your phone’s tethering to connect your laptop for a short time once in a while is fine, but for frequent travel, especially with multiple users, a dedicated device is much more efficient. It provides better Wi-Fi for better signal and more devices. Plans for hotspots are more flexible since they’re prepaid and easily cancellable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div data-widget="text-content" class="text-content text-content--align-default text--p-medium text--color- component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speed - 3.5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Verizon’s broadband facts label, its hotspot service on 5G has speeds of 35–143Mbps. All of its plans, with the exception of the Essential tier, can also access its 5G Ultra Wideband service, which is located in a handful of major cities but can provide speeds up to 634Mbps. When traveling cross country, you’ll likely only be on standard 5G, and when really off the beaten path, you’ll likely use 4G LTE, which provides speeds up to 75Mbps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliability - 3.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all devices and services that are powered by 5G, your hotspot’s reliability and signal will entirely depend on your proximity to Verizon’s cellular towers. Luckily, Verizon’s network covers a majority of the U.S., though it’s mostly 4G LTE. Verizon doesn’t have an unlimited data option for its hotspot plans, but the tiers of data are plenty for RV travelers on a long weekend road trip. The amount of data will likely depend on your typical usage and how many passengers you have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portability - 4.8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most modern hotspots are small enough to fit in your pocket, and the Inseego MiFi X PRO is no exception. It’s lightweight, no bigger than a smartphone, and has a battery life of up to 13 hours. If you’re traveling in an RV, then keeping it charged should be no problem. The strong Wi-Fi 6 of the Inseego will ensure that your RV and the surrounding campground will be covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value - 3.3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon Hotspots are for travelers who need a decent internet connection but don’t need or want to pay for an expensive high-speed internet solution like Starlink Roam or T-Mobile. However, to take advantage of its best prices, you’ll need to already be a Verizon customer. Its plan prices are incredibly affordable, but you need to take into account the added cost of the hotspot device. Whether you get one from Verizon or another source, any adequate device can be quite expensive. Ones with decent battery life and Wi-Fi typically cost $200 to $300, which is why I recommend going with one you can buy through a payment plan like Verizon’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div data-widget="text-content" class="text-content text-content--align-default text--p-medium text--color- component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;p&gt;T-Mobile has the most comprehensive 5G coverage of any cellular network hotspot plan. Their base plan is also very affordable, at only $10 per month for 2GB of data, and its bigger data tiers are also priced competitively. Because of its availability, we recommend T-Mobile for RV life since you’ll likely get the best coverage anywhere in the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has the second-best coverage in the U.S. Its prepaid, data-only plans are a one-time purchase and an excellent option to avoid overpaying for data you won’t use. However, its highest-tiered plans with the most data are among the most expensive.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon has the least coverage but has the most affordable plans, with its Essential plan starting at $10 per month for 15GB. However, the catch is that you must be a Verizon mobile customer to qualify for the low prices; otherwise, the hotspot plans on their own are much more expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;What is the status of Amazon Leo? When will it be ready for customers looking for an alternative to Starlink?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;What to Know About the Amazon Leo Beta&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;graphic src="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/app/uploads/2025/07/kuiper-amazon-liftoff.webp"/&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Amazon Leo, previously known as Project Kuiper, is steadily preparing to launch its satellite internet service and is now opening up its technology for beta testing. After multiple successful launches, Amazon is gradually building out its constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites that will be capable of beaming internet to ground terminals, directly competing with SpaceX’s Starlink.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For many who live in rural areas where options for high-speed internet access are scarce, satellite internet is often the only viable option. However, there are only three satellite internet providers that operate in the U.S., leaving little room for competition. Understandably, internet shoppers are curious about Amazon’s upcoming service, including when it will be available and what the cost will be. Like many new technologies, a beta launch that includes consumers is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;When will Amazon Leo's beta start?&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon has stated that its satellites are expected to begin operation by the end of 2025. There’s no formal sign-up page to participate in the planned beta program, but Amazon has invited select businesses to test the technology. Since Amazon is still in the process of testing and launching the first wave of satellites, a wider beta test hasn't been announced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, if you’re intent on being an early adopter, Amazon recommends contacting them directly to express your interest and receive additional information at kuiper-interest@amazon.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;graphic src="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/app/uploads/2025/03/standard-terminal-e1749768292689-1024x565.webp"/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A rendering of a Project Kuiper terminal in use at a home. Project Kuiper has many similarities to Starlink, though Amazon promises to be competitively priced and offer speeds up to 400Mbps | Image by Amazon&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;What to expect in the Amazon Leo beta&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon hasn’t released any details on the beta, but it’s possible that it will work very similarly to Starlink’s beta process. SpaceX began with a private beta in 2020, which later expanded into a full public beta called the “Better Than Nothing Beta.” Anyone could sign up and hope for a chance to be included, but factors for being selected depended on location, as the satellite constellation was not yet fully built out at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If selected, testers would be required to pay a monthly fee of $99. Additionally, since it was a beta, the service didn’t perform nearly as well as it does today, often experiencing constant outages. It’s safe to say that Project Kuiper beta won’t immediately deliver the promised 400Mbps that Amazon claims it will.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;A timeline of Amazon Leo progress&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;October 6, 2023: Amazon launches its prototype satellites KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat-2.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;May 23, 2024: After successful testing, Amazon begins deorbiting its prototypes and prepares to manufacture its constellation of satellites for launch.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;April 28, 2025: Amazon successfully launched the first of many satellites in its next significant step toward bringing its Project Kuiper satellite internet service online.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;October 13, 2025: The Project Kuiper constellation reaches 150+ satellites with launches from SpaceX and the United Launch Alliance.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Can’t wait for Amazon Leo and need internet now?&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the launch of Project Kuiper’s satellite constellation is underway, it still has a long way to go before it reaches its milestones of at least 1,600 satellites by July 2026 and 3,200 by 2029. The rate of launches so far also makes a 2025 beta a long shot. It’s safe to say that full commercial service won’t be ready for some time. However, if you’re in need of reliable internet that can be set up from anywhere, including rural settings, it’s likely a good idea to consider the three operational satellite providers: Hughesnet, Starlink, and Viasat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Will the wait for Amazon Leo be worth it?&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are still many uncertainties surrounding Amazon Leo, including service plans, pricing, availability, and a definitive release date. Amazon has promised speeds up to 400Mbps with its standard dishes and up to 1Gbps with its enterprise model. It’s also stated that the service will be competitively priced. Despite these uncertainties, having another provider in the industry is likely to impact the market and prompt competitors to respond with modified pricing and packages. More competition is beneficial for the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;

            <title>Starlink Mini Review: Is the Smaller, Lighter Starlink Worth It?</title>
            <link>https://www.satelliteinternet.com/resources/starlink-mini-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.satelliteinternet.com/resources/starlink-mini-review/</guid>
            <pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 21:39:36 +0000</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;&lt;div class="small-12  large-12 cell         "&gt;&lt;div data-widget="disclaimer" class="disclaimer component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;div class="text--p-xsmall disclaimer__disclaimer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starlink's internal speed test tool shows that both download speeds for Device-to-Starlink and Starlink-to-Internet were consistently in line, showing the strength of the onboard Wi-Fi. | Screenshot of Starlink app&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-widget="text-content" class="text-content text-content--align-default text--p-medium text--color- component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was plenty enough speed for me to browse the web, stream music, and even watch a live stream. I could do everything with the Starlink Mini that I could with a Standard dish. Additionally, just as with the Standard, latency remained low, making page loading and streaming seamless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upload speed lagged behind a little, but it was still sufficient to work from the road. My coworker, who also tested the Starlink Mini, was able to video call me from the road. The picture and sound were high quality, with no interruptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I cannot guarantee that everyone will achieve the same speeds, as Starlink's performance depends heavily on location, time of day, and network capacity. Mileage will vary, but I'm confident that most users will be able to receive sufficient speeds for most internet applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-widget="heading" class="heading component-margin--medium "&gt;  &lt;p class="clwp-heading-container clwp-heading-container--default clwp-heading-container--align-default"&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How reliable is the Starlink Mini?&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-widget="text-content" class="text-content text-content--align-default text--p-medium text--color- component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starlink's dishes are engineered to be intuitive to set up and use. The Mini is even more so since it's meant to be used on the go. Just like the Standard dish, the first time I set up the Mini, it took several minutes to update the software so I could start using it. In fact, every time I break it out to connect, it usually takes a few minutes for the Mini to begin communicating with satellites. However, once it does, it maintains its connection, even if you move it around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant appeal of the latest Starlink hardware is that it can be used while in motion. I took it with me on a brief road trip, securing it to my dashboard and turning off my smartphone's 5G. I was able to stream my music and podcasts while driving on the freeway without interruption. My passengers could also easily connect their phones to the Mini and use the web at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-widget="heading" class="heading component-margin--medium "&gt;  &lt;p class="clwp-heading-container clwp-heading-container--default clwp-heading-container--align-default"&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How strong is the Starlink Mini built-in Wi-Fi?&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-widget="text-content" class="text-content text-content--align-default text--p-medium text--color- component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Starlink Mini's onboard Wi-Fi router eliminates the need for an external router, further enhancing the device's portability. One drawback is that it runs on the older Wi-Fi 5 standard rather than the newer Wi-Fi 6. The key difference lies in performance and the number of devices that can wirelessly connect to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has a single Ethernet port that could be used to connect it directly to a computer or an external router. When using an external router, you need to set the Starlink Mini to bypass mode, which effectively disables the internal router. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-widget="disclaimer" class="disclaimer component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;div class="text--p-xsmall disclaimer__disclaimer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Starlink Mini requires only one cable for power, but an optional plug is available to connect to a separate Wi-Fi router. | Photo by Allaina Jeffreys for SatelliteInternet.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-widget="text-content" class="text-content text-content--align-default text--p-medium text--color- component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recommend using an external router if you need stronger Wi-Fi, such as for better performance, extended reach, or to connect more devices. However, I found that the Mini's onboard Wi-Fi is sufficient when connecting a handful of devices. I also found it has a pretty good range—I was still able to connect my phone from up to about 350 feet away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-widget="disclaimer" class="disclaimer component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;div class="text--p-xsmall disclaimer__disclaimer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For improved Wi-Fi, the Starlink Mini can be paired with a similarly compact Starlink router. | Image by Starlink&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-widget="text-content" class="text-content text-content--align-default text--p-medium text--color- component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starlink recently released a Mini Router to supplement the onboard Wi-Fi of the Mini dish. While I found the Mini's Wi-Fi to be sufficient for most use cases, it uses the older generation of Wi-Fi 5. This new router implements Wi-Fi 6, which is faster, more secure, and able to connect to more devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also be used as a mesh device for any Starlink version, allowing you to extend your Wi-Fi network well beyond its typical range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-widget="heading" class="heading component-margin--medium "&gt;  &lt;p class="clwp-heading-container clwp-heading-container--default clwp-heading-container--align-default"&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to power the Starlink Mini&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-widget="text-content" class="text-content text-content--align-default text--p-medium text--color- component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A drawback of the Starlink Mini is powering the dish. It's engineered to be a more portable version of Starlink, but the satellite internet provider gives customers few options for powering the dish without investing in additional equipment. It also provides little guidance on which power source will work with the Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Starlink Mini kit includes a 50-foot DC power cable and a power supply. The lengthy power cord and power supply are cumbersome and add extra weight to the whole kit. Unless you have a mobile power source, such as an RV or trailer, you may struggle to find an outlet when out in nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kit doesn't include the 16-foot USB-C power cable, which you'll need to purchase separately from Starlink. It requires a 100W (20V/5A) power source, so when shopping for a portable power source, ensure it meets this requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-widget="heading" class="heading component-margin--medium "&gt;  &lt;p class="clwp-heading-container clwp-heading-container--default clwp-heading-container--align-default"&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essential Starlink Mini accessories&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-widget="text-content" class="text-content text-content--align-default text--p-medium text--color- component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used the Anker 737 Power Bank for the majority of my testing. It was more than enough to power the dish fully and would last about three hours when actively using it with the Mini. When shopping around for a portable power bank, those rated for at least 100W typically cost between $60 and $200. You should look for power banks designed to charge laptops rather than just small devices. Different power banks have different capacities, so I would go with one like my Anker, which gives me decent online time. I also recommend getting a power bank that displays power stats, including how much battery time is left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-widget="disclaimer" class="disclaimer component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;div class="text--p-xsmall disclaimer__disclaimer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Starlink Mini pairs well with my laptop's power bank, providing approximately three hours of uptime. Plus, it’s easy enough to carry in my backpack with the dish. | Photo by Andreas Rivera for SatelliteInternet.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-widget="text-content" class="text-content text-content--align-default text--p-medium text--color- component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other accessories to consider include the Mini Car Adaptor from Starlink, allowing you to plug your dish into your car’s 12 to 24V auxiliary outlet (a.k.a. the cigarette lighter). It’s perfect for long road trips and also comes with the essential USB-C power cable, but it’s an extra $45. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other accessories sold by Starlink include mounting kits for your vehicle and a carrying case made to protect your Mini dish. These are for specific use cases, but my laptop backpack was enough to carry everything. In my vehicle, it was easy enough to secure it to my dashboard with some removable adhesive strips. &lt;/p&gt;

I tested the T-Mobile AWAY service and gateway device over the course of several weeks. Both Starlink and T-Mobile are reliable mobile internet solutions, but they are definitely for different types of users. T-Mobile is ideal for RVs, campers, and frequent travelers who don't venture too far off the grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My speed tests would fall between 150 and 300Mbps. It works off the same 5G network as T-Mobile's home internet, so it's available to use anywhere you're in range of its cellular towers. It's a more affordable, temporary mobile internet solution, and though its network expands across the U.S., it still has limits to its reach, especially in very remote areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Starlink Mini has few limits to its availability, it is more expensive in the short term because of its upfront cost. Its true appeal is the portability and ability to take it with you in a backpack, making it ideal for those exploring the backcountry and traveling to very remote locations.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How will Amazon Leo's upcoming Nano compare to Starlink?&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-widget="disclaimer" class="disclaimer component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;div class="text--p-xsmall disclaimer__disclaimer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Amazon Leo Nano is a direct response to Starlink's popular Mini, which is used for easy traveling internet. | Image by Amazon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-widget="text-content" class="text-content text-content--align-default text--p-medium text--color- component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon announced its own competing satellite internet service, powered by similar LEO technology as Starlink, and will also include a mobile option. Amazon Leo is aiming to launch in 2026 and will include a direct rival to the Starlink Mini called the Nano. The Nano is 7 inches by 7 inches, which is comparable to the Starlink Mini dish, which is about 11.5 inches by 10 inches. So it's a bit smaller, but there are still a few unknowns, such as whether it will have an internal Wi-Fi router like the Mini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon claims the Leo Nano will support download speeds up to 100Mbps. Much lower than what the Mini is capable of, but it's possible Amazon Leo's speeds will increase over time as it launches more of its own satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pricing and launch information have not been announced as of December 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-widget="heading" class="heading component-margin--medium "&gt;  &lt;p class="clwp-heading-container clwp-heading-container--default clwp-heading-container--align-default"&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is the Starlink Mini worth it?&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-widget="text-content" class="text-content text-content--align-default text--p-medium text--color- component-margin--medium "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Starlink Mini is a powerful tool in a small package that I thoroughly enjoyed testing—an excellent solution for on-the-go internet that's easy to use. The barrier to entry I can foresee for most people is the high price tag. That price tag gets even higher when you consider the multiple accessories I would say are essential for the Mini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's still a perfect companion for the backpackers, nomads, and weekend warriors who need a reliable way to get high-speed internet nearly anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Internet speeds and availability are better than ever, but even the most basic connection can be too expensive for many U.S. households, especially satellite solutions for rural homes. To stay connected and take advantage of the internet's economic and educational benefits, qualifying families can access discounted internet service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) was previously the best way to get a reduced internet bill ($30 off) from nearly any provider, but Congress has since run out of funding. Despite the ACP's expiration for the foreseeable future, there are other public and provider-driven options to assist families with their internet bills.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
