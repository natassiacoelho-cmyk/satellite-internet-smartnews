    <p>Starlink and Viasat will be at the top of your search if you're trying to choose a satellite internet provider. While Starlink is the frontrunner in terms of speed and convenience, Viasat may be a more affordable option with decent speeds. I found this out myself after using both providers for several months. I also interviewed several current and former customers.</p>
    <p>Starlink offers the fastest speeds and lowest latency among all satellite ISPs. However, Starlink's hands-off support approach may turn off some customers, and you have to pay extra upfront for Starlink hardware.</p>
    <p>"With Starlink, I'm able to do everything I need: online gaming and video conferencing," said Starlink customer Jason Astel.</p>
    <p>In early 2024, Viasat completely revamped its internet plans, consolidating them into a single offering called Unleashed. This offering offers unlimited data and no contract. While Viasat has download speeds on par with most providers, it's held back by the high latency inherent in its satellite technology and higher monthly price.</p>
    <p>"When it's tuned well, it's very reasonable," said former Viasat customer Jim Olsen.</p>
    <p>I tested Starlink and Viasat at my family cabin in rural Utah to compare the satellite internet providers. What I found was surprising.</p>

            <title>Starlink Congestion Charge Up to $1,500. When Will Capacity Increase?</title>
            <link>https://www.satelliteinternet.com/resources/starlink-congestion-surcharge/</link>
            <guid>https://www.satelliteinternet.com/resources/starlink-congestion-surcharge/</guid>
            <pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 17:29:32 +0000</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><html>
  <body>
    <p><a href="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/providers/starlink/">Starlink</a> continues to charge a demand surcharge for new Residential customers in select regions to control network congestion, but many buyers are shocked that the one-time fee in their area can be up to $1,500. Several potential customers <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/1qm6hin/1500_for_demand_surcharge_remote_alaska_fairbanks/">reported on social media</a> about the hefty surcharge. </p>
    <p>The $1,500 surcharge is appearing in cities across Alaska, where internet options are few and far between, especially much-sought-after fiber services. So, it's understandable that Starlink is a popular option in the region, with few reliable choices.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, other locations that previously had surcharges of up to $1,000, such as the Pacific Northwest, have seen them drop to $500, which is still a high price for satellite internet service.</p>
    <p>Before the congestion charges, Starlink was “Sold Out” in several regions, and buyers were placed on a waitlist with a deposit. The Pacific Northwest and the Atlantic Southeast have frequently been subject to Starlink's network congestion rules.</p>
    <p>The waitlists were recently lifted in several regions in favor of <a href="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/starlink-congestion-fee-doubles-in-several-cities/">one-time congestion charges</a>, though they could reach $250 for many. Now that North Carolina, Oregon, and Washington are no longer marked as sold out, customers can purchase Starlink, but with a large one-time fee.</p>

            <title>Starlink Roadmap 2026: When is Gigabit Speed Arriving?</title>
            <link>https://www.satelliteinternet.com/resources/starlink-2-gigabit-speeds-available-soon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.satelliteinternet.com/resources/starlink-2-gigabit-speeds-available-soon/</guid>
            <pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 18:44:54 +0000</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><html>
  <body>
    <div  ><p>Starlink isn't the only satellite internet company with ambitions for gigabit speeds. Amazon Leo, formerly known as Project Kuiper, has announced plans for 1Gbps download speeds, with the service available as soon as the end of 2026. Whether or not that comes to fruition, both companies are now racing to the point where they can confidently tell customers that their service is capable of 1Gbps speeds. While less is known about Amazon Leo's satellite technology, Starlink has outlined its plans in a loose roadmap to get to that point. </p>
</div>
    <div  ><p>Starlink’s ambition to provide fiber-like speeds from space will begin with its next-generation satellites. The company has been launching its second-generation satellites, which use laser communication for faster data transmission. It has announced that it’s developing a third-generation of satellites to achieve greater bandwidth. These satellites will be larger and able to transmit exponentially more data.</p>
<p>"SpaceX is targeting to begin launching its third-generation satellites in 2026," according to Starlink's 2025 end of year report. The document claims that each satellite can provide 10 times the downlink capacity of current-generation satellites. </p>
<p>With one terabit of bandwidth, third-generation satellites could handle more ground terminals at higher speeds. The report does not mention when the V3 satellites will be ready for launch.</p>
</div>
    <div  ><p>The other phase of boosting Starlink speeds will also depend on the number of satellites SpaceX can launch into lower Earth orbit. As of the beginning of 2025, there are about 6,800 working Starlink satellites, but the company’s goal is to operate close to 30,000. Since the satellites have a lifespan of about five years, they will need to be continually launched to replace those that burn up in the atmosphere. </p>
<p>The key to this initiative is SpaceX’s Starship vehicle, which the company has been testing throughout 2025, with more successes than failures. Starship is unique in that it’s engineered to be completely reusable. SpaceX successfully tested its “Mechzilla” launch tower, which also catches the booster when it returns to the ground. Ideally, SpaceX can launch Starship and its payload, land it, refuel it, and then launch again within hours.</p>
<p>“I would not be surprised if we fly Starship 400 times in the next 4 years, said <a href="https://x.com/xdNiBoR/status/1857866735698792646">SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell</a>, speaking at an investor conference.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Along with the discount, Starlink is also offering a free Mini dish to Residential MAX customers.</p>
    <h1>Starlink Mini Price Slashed to $199</h1>
    <graphic src="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/app/uploads/2025/05/roam_c_casestudy_travel_2.webp"/>
    <p>The Starlink Mini is half the size of the Standard dish, but is nearly double the cost. It's now on sale for the most affordable it's been. | Image by Starlink</p>
    <p>SpaceX dropped the price of its Starlink Mini dish for a surprise sale to $199, the lowest it has ever been. The duration of the sale is unknown, but the last time it was discounted, the promotion lasted for one month. The <a href="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/providers/">Starlink Mini dish's</a> regular price is $299. </p>
    <p>The Starlink Mini is an even more portable version of the Standard dish. Coming in at half the size and weight, it has a built-in Wi-Fi router and requires less power. <a href="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/resources/starlink-mini-review/">I tested and reviewed the Starlink Mini</a> and found it to be powerful, delivering high download speeds anywhere with a clear view of the sky, as long as you have a reliable power source that’s just as portable.</p>
    <h2>Starlink Roam plans for the Mini</h2>
    <p>It’s the latest move by Starlink in its aggressive push to discount and sell its hardware in select regions. Starlink recently launched a program offering new customers a <a href="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/resources/starlink-2025-regional-discount/">discounted Standard dish and reduced monthly residential rates in select regions</a>.</p>
    <p>The sale on the Mini also comes on the heels of the newly released Starlink Mini Router. The Starlink Router Mini is available on its online shop for $40. It extends the reach of the Starlink Mini with a slightly more powerful Wi-Fi router.</p>
    <graphic src="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/app/uploads/2025/05/Starlink-Mini-router-1024x684.webp"/>
    <p>The Starlink Mini Router was released to supplement the Mini's onboard Wi-Fi. Like the Mini dish, the Router is a shrunken-down version of the Standard router. | Image by Starlink</p>
    <p>While the Starlink Mini has an onboard router to connect to devices, it’s the last-generation version of Wi-Fi 5, which has less reach and is unable to handle as many devices. The new router carries Wi-Fi 6, which is faster and more secure.</p>
    <h2>Free Starlink Mini rental for residential customers</h2>
    <p>In addition to the sale, customers on Starlink's MAX plan are being offered a free Starlink Mini rental that can be used with the Roam plans. Since it's a rental, if a customer cancels or changes their plan, they're responsible for returning the Mini back to Starlink.</p>

            <title>Starlink Mini Review: Is the Smaller, Lighter Starlink Worth It?</title>
            <link>https://www.satelliteinternet.com/resources/starlink-mini-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.satelliteinternet.com/resources/starlink-mini-review/</guid>
            <pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 21:39:36 +0000</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><html>
  <body><div ><div  ><div ><p>Starlink's internal speed test tool shows that both download speeds for Device-to-Starlink and Starlink-to-Internet were consistently in line, showing the strength of the onboard Wi-Fi. | Screenshot of Starlink app</p></div></div><div  ><p>It was plenty enough speed for me to browse the web, stream music, and even watch a live stream. I could do everything with the Starlink Mini that I could with a Standard dish. Additionally, just as with the Standard, latency remained low, making page loading and streaming seamless. </p>
<p>Upload speed lagged behind a little, but it was still sufficient to work from the road. My coworker, who also tested the Starlink Mini, was able to video call me from the road. The picture and sound were high quality, with no interruptions. </p>
<p>However, I cannot guarantee that everyone will achieve the same speeds, as Starlink's performance depends heavily on location, time of day, and network capacity. Mileage will vary, but I'm confident that most users will be able to receive sufficient speeds for most internet applications.</p>
</div><div  >  <p >
    </p><h2>How reliable is the Starlink Mini?</h2>  
</div><div  ><p>Starlink's dishes are engineered to be intuitive to set up and use. The Mini is even more so since it's meant to be used on the go. Just like the Standard dish, the first time I set up the Mini, it took several minutes to update the software so I could start using it. In fact, every time I break it out to connect, it usually takes a few minutes for the Mini to begin communicating with satellites. However, once it does, it maintains its connection, even if you move it around. </p>
<p>A significant appeal of the latest Starlink hardware is that it can be used while in motion. I took it with me on a brief road trip, securing it to my dashboard and turning off my smartphone's 5G. I was able to stream my music and podcasts while driving on the freeway without interruption. My passengers could also easily connect their phones to the Mini and use the web at the same time.</p>
</div><div  >  <p >
    </p><h2>How strong is the Starlink Mini built-in Wi-Fi?</h2>  
</div><div  ><p>The Starlink Mini's onboard Wi-Fi router eliminates the need for an external router, further enhancing the device's portability. One drawback is that it runs on the older Wi-Fi 5 standard rather than the newer Wi-Fi 6. The key difference lies in performance and the number of devices that can wirelessly connect to it. </p>
<p>It has a single Ethernet port that could be used to connect it directly to a computer or an external router. When using an external router, you need to set the <a href="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/resources/starlink-router-bypass-mode/">Starlink Mini to bypass mode</a>, which effectively disables the internal router. </p>
</div><div  ><div ><p>The Starlink Mini requires only one cable for power, but an optional plug is available to connect to a separate Wi-Fi router. | Photo by Allaina Jeffreys for SatelliteInternet.com.</p></div></div><div  ><p>I recommend using an external router if you need stronger Wi-Fi, such as for better performance, extended reach, or to connect more devices. However, I found that the Mini's onboard Wi-Fi is sufficient when connecting a handful of devices. I also found it has a pretty good range—I was still able to connect my phone from up to about 350 feet away.</p>
</div><div  ><div ><p>For improved Wi-Fi, the Starlink Mini can be paired with a similarly compact Starlink router. | Image by Starlink</p></div></div><div  ><p>Starlink recently released a Mini Router to supplement the onboard Wi-Fi of the Mini dish. While I found the Mini's Wi-Fi to be sufficient for most use cases, it uses the older generation of Wi-Fi 5. This new router implements Wi-Fi 6, which is faster, more secure, and able to connect to more devices.</p>
<p>It can also be used as a mesh device for any Starlink version, allowing you to extend your Wi-Fi network well beyond its typical range.</p>
</div><div  >  <p >
    </p><h2>How to power the Starlink Mini</h2>  
</div><div  ><p>A drawback of the Starlink Mini is powering the dish. It's engineered to be a more portable version of Starlink, but the satellite internet provider gives customers few options for powering the dish without investing in additional equipment. It also provides little guidance on which power source will work with the Mini.</p>
<p>The Starlink Mini kit includes a 50-foot DC power cable and a power supply. The lengthy power cord and power supply are cumbersome and add extra weight to the whole kit. Unless you have a mobile power source, such as an RV or trailer, you may struggle to find an outlet when out in nature. </p>
<p>The kit doesn't include the 16-foot USB-C power cable, which you'll need to purchase separately from Starlink. It requires a 100W (20V/5A) power source, so when shopping for a portable power source, ensure it meets this requirement. </p>
</div><div  >  <p >
    </p><h2>Essential Starlink Mini accessories</h2>  
</div><div  ><p>I used the <a href="https://amzn.to/4kG0hWo">Anker 737 Power Bank</a> for the majority of my testing. It was more than enough to power the dish fully and would last about three hours when actively using it with the Mini. When shopping around for a portable power bank, those rated for at least 100W typically cost between $60 and $200. You should look for power banks designed to charge laptops rather than just small devices. Different power banks have different capacities, so I would go with one like my Anker, which gives me decent online time. I also recommend getting a power bank that displays power stats, including how much battery time is left.</p>
</div><div  ><div ><p>The Starlink Mini pairs well with my laptop's power bank, providing approximately three hours of uptime. Plus, it’s easy enough to carry in my backpack with the dish. | Photo by Andreas Rivera for SatelliteInternet.com</p></div></div><div  ><p>Other accessories to consider include the Mini Car Adaptor from Starlink, allowing you to plug your dish into your car’s 12 to 24V auxiliary outlet (a.k.a. the cigarette lighter). It’s perfect for long road trips and also comes with the essential USB-C power cable, but it’s an extra $45. </p>
<p>Other accessories sold by Starlink include mounting kits for your vehicle and a carrying case made to protect your Mini dish. These are for specific use cases, but my laptop backpack was enough to carry everything. In my vehicle, it was easy enough to secure it to my dashboard with some removable adhesive strips. </p>

        </div></div></div><div  ><p>T-Mobile AWAY is a rival mobile internet solution that's powered by 5G. I tested the T-Mobile AWAY service and gateway device over several weeks. Both <a href="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/resources/starlink-roam-vs-t-mobile-away/">Starlink and T-Mobile are reliable mobile internet solutions</a>, but they are definitely for different types of users. T-Mobile is ideal for RVs, campers, and frequent travelers who don't venture too far off the grid.</p>
<p>My speed tests would fall between 150 and 300Mbps. It uses the same 5G network as T-Mobile's home internet, so it's available anywhere you're in range of its cellular towers. It's a more affordable, temporary mobile internet solution, and though its network spans the U.S., it still has limited reach, especially in very remote areas.</p>
<p>While Starlink Mini has near-unlimited availability, it is more expensive in the short term due to its upfront cost. Its true appeal lies in its portability and the ability to carry it in a backpack, making it ideal for those exploring the backcountry and traveling to very remote locations.</p>

    </p><h2>How will Amazon Leo's upcoming Nano compare to Starlink?</h2>  
</div><div  ><div ><p>The Amazon Leo Nano is a direct response to Starlink's popular Mini, which is used for easy traveling internet. | Image by Amazon</p></div></div><div  ><p><a href="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/providers/amazon-leo/">Amazon announced its own competing satellite internet service</a>, powered by similar LEO technology as Starlink, and will also include a mobile option. Amazon Leo is aiming to launch in 2026 and will consist of a direct rival to the Starlink Mini called the Nano. The Nano is 7 inches by 7 inches, which is comparable to the Starlink Mini dish, which is about 11.5 inches by 10 inches. So it's a bit smaller, but there are still a few unknowns, such as whether it will have an internal Wi-Fi router like the Mini. </p>
<p>Amazon claims the Leo Nano will support download speeds up to 100Mbps. Much lower than what the Mini is capable of, but Amazon Leo's speeds may increase over time as it launches additional satellites.</p>
<p>Pricing and launch information have not been announced as of December 2025.</p>
</div><div  >  <p >
    </p><h2>Is the Starlink Mini worth it?</h2>  
</div><div  ><p>The Starlink Mini is a powerful tool in a small package that I thoroughly enjoyed testing—an excellent solution for on-the-go internet that's easy to use. The barrier to entry I can foresee for most people is the high price tag. That price tag gets even higher when you consider the multiple accessories I would say are essential for the Mini. </p>
<p>It's still a perfect companion for the backpackers, nomads, and weekend warriors who need a reliable way to get high-speed internet nearly anywhere.</p>

            <title>Starlink for RVs: A Complete Starlink Roam Review</title>
            <link>https://www.satelliteinternet.com/resources/starlink-roam-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.satelliteinternet.com/resources/starlink-roam-review/</guid>
            <pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 23:27:58 +0000</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><html>
  <body>
    <div  ><p>Starlink Roam starts at $50 per month and includes 100GB of data, more than enough for a long weekend on the road or camping. For unlimited data, the monthly cost is $165. However, that’s not the only cost to get Starlink Roam up and running. You’ll also pay a one-time fee of $349 for a Standard Starlink dish or $299 for the more portable Mini dish. </p>
<p>If you only use your Starlink sporadically, like for weekend trips, there is a Standby pause mode. It's $5 per month and still offers low-speed internet (0.5Mbps). You can also cancel your plan at any time for no charge and reactivate it whenever you need it again. It’s pretty convenient, considering how pricey Starlink Roam can be compared to some alternative <a href="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/resources/satellite-internet-vs-mobile-hotspot/">mobile Wi-Fi options</a>. Fortunately, depending on the length of your RV adventure, you can determine if the price tag is worth it.</p>
<p>Starlink offers a “trial” period of its equipment and services. After receiving your kit and activating the first month’s subscription, you can cancel within 30 days for a full refund, provided you return the Starlink equipment in an undamaged condition. There’s a retail fee penalty for damaged goods, so be extra careful with your borrowed hardware if you decide to go that route.</p>
</div>
    <div  ><p>The <a href="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/resources/everything-we-know-about-starlink-mini/">Starlink Mini</a> is an even more portable version of its dish, shrunken down to nearly half the size and weight of the Standard dish. It has a built-in Wi-Fi router, unlike the Standard dish, which requires a proprietary router. It also requires less power.</p>
<p>The portability comes at the cost of reduced bandwidth. It's also more expensive than the Standard dish, with a regular price of $299. </p>
</div>
    <div  ><p>While the Mini can be more convenient than the Standard, since it takes up less space in an RV, it's possible to run into difficulties if you set up camp in an area with lots of obstructions. With the Standard dish, you can set it up far away from the RV to a better position with better clearance. With the Mini, you're limited by the equipment's power cable, and the Wi-Fi signal will be muted if you move it far from your RV, unless you have a mesh router from Starlink. </p>
<p>With a reliable, portable power source, the Mini is perfect for taking backpacking into the backcountry. </p>
</div>
    <div  ><p>According to Starlink’s official specifications, Roam provides download speeds of 30–100Mbps.  However, in our testing, Starlink Roam surprised us by exceeding promised speeds at times. </p>
<p>Starlink Roam does offer unlimited data, but at a lower <a href="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/resources/starlink-data-caps/">data deprioritization</a> rate than its fixed residential plan. Customers will experience weaker coverage and even slower speeds than customers on the Priority plans. It doesn’t guarantee you will experience those slowed speeds, but it means you easily could.</p>
<p>If your needs merit it, you can consider investing in the more expensive tiers of Starlink Roam for higher speeds (and global coverage). However, remember that these expensive alternatives come with monthly data caps, so you must monitor your usage.</p>

            <title>The Best RV Internet For Every Camper</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><html>
  <body>
    <div  ><p>Verizon offers the most variety and value in its hotspot plans among major carriers. It offers more data for lower prices, but only if you’re already a Verizon mobile customer. Its plans can be used with any modern hotspot device, although Verizon also sells its recommended devices on payment plans added to your monthly plan.  </p>
</div>
    <div  ><p>The device I recommend to go along with a Verizon hotspot plan is the Inseego MiFi X PRO. It’s an affordable hotspot device on a $ 9.72-per-month payment plan. It’s no bigger than a smartphone and has its own rechargeable battery that lasts up to 13 hours unplugged. It has Wi-Fi 6, which offers extended range and can connect up to 32 devices. </p>
</div>
    <div  ><p>Nearly every modern smartphone comes with a tethering feature that allows it to function as a hotspot. So why use a device and a separate plan? Phone hotspot data is often very limited, and going over your plan’s cap can result in hefty overage charges. A phone’s Wi-Fi reach is very limited and can only connect a few devices at a time. Plus, frequently using your phone rapidly drains its battery and shortens its lifespan. </p>
<p>Using your phone’s tethering to connect your laptop for a short time once in a while is fine, but for frequent travel, especially with multiple users, a dedicated device is much more efficient. It provides better Wi-Fi for better signal and more devices. Plans for hotspots are more flexible since they’re prepaid and easily cancellable. </p>
</div>
    <div  ><p>Speed - 3.5</p>
<p>According to Verizon’s broadband facts label, its hotspot service on 5G has speeds of 35–143Mbps. All of its plans, with the exception of the Essential tier, can also access its 5G Ultra Wideband service, which is located in a handful of major cities but can provide speeds up to 634Mbps. When traveling cross country, you’ll likely only be on standard 5G, and when really off the beaten path, you’ll likely use 4G LTE, which provides speeds up to 75Mbps. </p>
<p>Reliability - 3.0</p>
<p>Like all devices and services that are powered by 5G, your hotspot’s reliability and signal will entirely depend on your proximity to Verizon’s cellular towers. Luckily, Verizon’s network covers a majority of the U.S., though it’s mostly 4G LTE. Verizon doesn’t have an unlimited data option for its hotspot plans, but the tiers of data are plenty for RV travelers on a long weekend road trip. The amount of data will likely depend on your typical usage and how many passengers you have. </p>
<p>Portability - 4.8</p>
<p>Most modern hotspots are small enough to fit in your pocket, and the Inseego MiFi X PRO is no exception. It’s lightweight, no bigger than a smartphone, and has a battery life of up to 13 hours. If you’re traveling in an RV, then keeping it charged should be no problem. The strong Wi-Fi 6 of the Inseego will ensure that your RV and the surrounding campground will be covered.</p>
<p>Value - 3.3</p>
<p>Verizon Hotspots are for travelers who need a decent internet connection but don’t need or want to pay for an expensive high-speed internet solution like Starlink Roam or T-Mobile. However, to take advantage of its best prices, you’ll need to already be a Verizon customer. Its plan prices are incredibly affordable, but you need to take into account the added cost of the hotspot device. Whether you get one from Verizon or another source, any adequate device can be quite expensive. Ones with decent battery life and Wi-Fi typically cost $200 to $300, which is why I recommend going with one you can buy through a payment plan like Verizon’s.</p>
</div>
    <div  ><p><a href="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/go/t-mobile/mobile/">T-Mobile</a> has the most comprehensive 5G coverage of any cellular network hotspot plan. Their base plan is also very affordable, at only $10 per month for 2GB of data, and its bigger data tiers are also priced competitively. Because of its availability, we recommend T-Mobile for RV life since you’ll likely get the best coverage anywhere in the country.<br/></p>
<p><a href="https://go.satelliteinternet.com/aff_c?offer_id=753&amp;amp;aff_id=1006">AT&amp;amp;T</a> has the second-best coverage in the U.S. Its prepaid, data-only plans are a one-time purchase and an excellent option to avoid overpaying for data you won’t use. However, its highest-tiered plans with the most data are among the most expensive.  </p>
<p><a href="https://go.satelliteinternet.com/aff_c?offer_id=747&amp;amp;aff_id=1006">Verizon</a> has the least coverage but has the most affordable plans, with its Essential plan starting at $10 per month for 15GB. However, the catch is that you must be a Verizon mobile customer to qualify for the low prices; otherwise, the hotspot plans on their own are much more expensive. </p>

    <p>Starlink and T-Mobile announced the initial list of compatible phones that can send text messages via satellite connection.</p>
    <h1>What Phone Do I Need To Use T-Satellite?</h1>

    <p>Starlink Direct to Cell will supposedly be compatible with most modern cellphones and will expand its list of eligible devices. | Image by Starlink</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/resources/starlink-direct-to-cell/">T-Mobile's T-Satellite</a> direct-to-cell service has launched, and even customers of different carriers like AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon can sign up. Whether you can take advantage of the service, which lets you send text messages when out of cellular range, will depend on your phone. </p>
    <p>T-Mobile has stated that when fully launched, direct-to-cell satellite connectivity will be compatible with most modern phones from the last four years. However, only a handful of smartphone models are currently compatible. These include some of the latest models from Apple, Samsung, Google, and Motorola.</p>
    <p>The service is currently limited to this list, though Starlink and T-Mobile say older phone models are capable of using it. However, the hardware they want to expand satellite service to must have a specific certification from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Both companies sent a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/104082801524379/1">letter to the FCC</a> asking for a waiver of the rule. Their central argument is the usage of direct-to-cell for emergency situations, citing its use during the Southeast U.S. hurricanes of 2024.</p>
    <p>Here is the complete list of compatible phones as of January 12, 2026:</p>

    <h2>Interested in T-Satellite?</h2>
    <h2>How to use T-Mobile Starlink</h2>
    <p>Your phone’s Apple iOS or Android OS needs to be updated to the latest version. If accepted into the beta, you’ll receive a text message informing you you’re in. From there, you don’t need to do anything else. When out of cellular range, your phone will automatically connect to Starlink.</p>
    <p>T-Mobile also released an <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/coverage-map?msockid=11ddb33a88e46d2b2b1da71189c96c6c">updated coverage map</a> to show where Direct to Cell is usable. </p>
    <p>Since the service is currently in beta, customers can only send text messages. Several factors need to occur for the planed voice and data capabilities including regulatory changes and more Starlink satellites launched. T-Mobile said participants in the beta should temper their expectations and expect text messages to take longer to send over T-Mobile Starlink. For the best results, users should be outdoors and point their phones toward a clear sky.</p>
    <p>For customers of AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, and other carriers, your phone must be unlocked to use Starlink Direct to Cell. You must also download an eSIM to use your current carrier and T-Mobile Starlink. Different carriers have different rules for unlocking phones purchased through them, but typically, you can unlock phones after a certain amount of time owning them or when you finish making payments.</p>

    <p>Mobile dead zones are quickly becoming a thing of the past thanks to innovations of direct-to-device satellite coverage, currently being spearheaded by Starlink. Since the commercial launch of T-Satellite in July 2025, the partnership between T-Mobile and SpaceX has transitioned from a high-tech experiment into a valuable feature for those who venture off the beaten path.</p>
    <p>But the story doesn't stop with T-Mobile. Starlink’s "Direct to Cell" ambitions are scaling at a pace that could change mobile technology as we know it. With recent FCC approval for thousands of new, higher-powered satellites and a growing list of international carrier partners, SpaceX is setting up a global network for both broadband internet and mobile connectivity. Recent trademark filings for "Starlink Mobile" suggest that the company may soon move beyond partnerships to launch its own independent mobile service.</p>

    <p>It’s simple to buy or sell a used <a href="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/providers/starlink/">Starlink</a> kit, but there are a few steps you need to follow. One thing that sets Starlink apart from any other <a href="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/providers/">satellite internet provider</a> is that its hardware is transferable to a different owner. Customers can sell their equipment when they no longer need it to recoup their investment, which is excellent for people who want a Starlink kit but want to save money by buying one used.</p>
    <p>I decided to swap out my <a href="https://www.satelliteinternet.com/resources/starlink-standard-vs-mini/">Standard Starlink dish for the Starlink Mini</a> since I mainly use it seasonally and would like to take it with me when traveling. A friend of mine was willing to trade.</p>
    <p>Giving a Starlink kit to another user isn’t as simple as handing it over. You need to follow these instructions to transfer the kit; otherwise, it won’t work, and the recipient will be stuck with inoperable Starlink equipment.</p>
